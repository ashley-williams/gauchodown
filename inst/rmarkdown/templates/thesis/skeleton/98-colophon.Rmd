This document was typeset using the XeTeX typesetting system, and the [UNCG dissertation class](https://mathstats.uncg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/uncgdissertationexp.cls) class created by Dan Yasaki. Under the hood, the [UNCG dissertation LaTeX template](https://mathstats.uncg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sample.tex) is used to ensure that documents conform precisely to submission standards. Other elements of the document formatting source code have been taken from the [Latex, Knitr, and RMarkdown templates for UC Berkeley's graduate thesis](https://github.com/stevenpollack/ucbthesis), and [Dissertate: a LaTeX dissertation template to support the production and typesetting of a PhD dissertation at Harvard, Princeton, and NYU](https://github.com/suchow/Dissertate)

The source files for this thesis, along with all the data files, have been organised into an R package, xxx, which is available at https://github.com/xxx/xxx. A hard copy of the thesis can be found in the University of North Carolina at Greensboro library.

This version of the thesis was generated on `r Sys.time()`. The repository is currently at this commit:

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# I've set eval=FALSE to ensure Travis-CI can run
# if you're not using Travis-CI, then eval=TRUE will be fine
# library(git2r)
# if ( git2r::in_repository() ) {
#        summary(commits()[[1]])
# } else {
#        message("We are not in a git repository")
# }
```

The computational environment that was used to generate this version is as follows:

```{r echo = FALSE}
devtools::session_info()
```
